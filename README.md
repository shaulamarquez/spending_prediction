# Linear Regression Project
This is a guided project with Alejandro-ao on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2Cw82YR5Bo&t=1390s). 

I'm going to help them decide whether to focus on website or mobile app.

## What is in the data?

You can get the data from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iyadavvaibhav/ecommerce-customer-device-usage).
The data includes information about customers of an e-commerce website, including the following:

* Avg. Session Length: Average session of in-store style advice sessions.
* Time on App: Average time spent on App in minutes
* Time on Website: Average time spent on Website in minutes
* Length of Membership: How many years the customer has been a member. Note that all the personal information is not real.
